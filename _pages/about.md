Hi! I'm Brandon Lee Concepcion, a current undergraduate third-year studying Data Science and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. 

Outside of my own academics, Iâ€™m committed to empowering students to accomplish their personal and academic ambitions, ensuring that each of my students are well-equipped with the resources they need to succeed.

I currently hold positions as an Undergraduate Student Instructor for UC Berkeley's College of Computing, Data Science, and Society (CDSS), as well as the Course Director for the Data Science Society at Berkeley.
