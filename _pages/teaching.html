I am a current member of the teaching staff for DATA C8: Foundations of Data Science, a 1,200+ person course at UC Berkeley. Data 8 brings together a diverse group of students from various majors and technical backgrounds, teaching the core concepts of inference and computing through hands-on experience with real data.
