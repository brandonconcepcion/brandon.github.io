                        Vicki Lee-Concepcion is my hero, and also my mother. There are too many words to say how grateful and appreciative I am of her,
                        but one thing I can definitely say is that she is the perfect mom for me. She has the nicest and kindest heart, 
                        the drive to do anything for her family, and will never, <i>ever</i>, give up. Everything I do is for her. 
                        Love you mom!

                        Ricardo Arellano Concepcion is another one of my heroes, and also my father. He's the person who showed me 
                        how to transitioning from young boy, to adolescent, and now an adult. Ricardo has a big heart, but even bigger soul. He's my #1 supporter, 
                        and I'm really proud to be his son. Love you Dad!

                        Cayle is my sister, and also my best friend. She graduated from UC Berkeley in the Spring of 2023
                        with Highest Honors in Integrative Biology. I have so many fond memories growing up with her. She's given me so much advice throughout the years, I honestly don't know if I can pay it all back.

                        Teddy is a pandemic maltipoo who has a LOT of energy. We love to take naps together, go on walks, 
                        and play fetch. Teddy's favorite vegetable is bell pepper, and he's our resident guard dog around 
                        the house. I miss him a lot when I'm away from home

                        Cookie is a rescue dog which my family saved in November of 2023. 
                        She's really sweet towards humans, and is particularily a fan of eating food and taking naps. 
                        Whenever I'm having a rough time, I always go and give Cook Cook a big hug

                        Jonathan has probably been the single most influential person I have met at Cal. He's taught me so many 
                        things about being a great instructor, a great data scientist, and also a great person! Jonathan is someone 
                        I very much look up to, and he's like my older brother
